								These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with
								Israeli law without regard to conflict of law principles. Any
								disputes relating to these Terms and the use of the Services
								will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
								Tel Aviv. If any of the terms or conditions of these Terms are
								deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, but
								not limited to the exclusions and limitations set out above),
								then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be severed from
								these Terms and the remaining terms will continue to apply. If
								any provision of these Terms is inconsistent with, or cannot be
								fully enforced under, the law, such provision will be construed
								as limited to the extent necessary to be consistent with and
								fully enforceable under the law. These Terms are the final,
								complete and exclusive agreement between the parties relating to
								the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or
								contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating to such
								subject matter, whether oral or written. These Terms may only be
								modified in writing signed by our authorized officer. You shall
								not assign these Terms or assign any rights or delegate any
								obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily
								or by operation of law, without our prior written consent. Any
								purported assignment or delegation by you without our
								appropriate prior written consent will be null and void. We may
								assign these Terms or any rights hereunder without restriction.
								These Terms constitute the full and entire understanding and
								agreement between you and us with regard to the subject matters
								hereof, and replace any prior agreement pertaining to the

								constitute a part of these Terms and will not be deemed to limit
								or affect any of the provisions hereof. Our failure to enforce
								any right or provision of these Terms, or failure to exercise
								any option to terminate, will not be deemed a waiver of such
								right or provision and shall not affect the validity of these
								Terms or any part thereof, or the right thereafter to enforce
								each and every provision. Any waiver of any provision of any
								term in these Terms will be effective only if in writing, signed
								by the waiving party. Any notice or other communication to be
								given hereunder will be in writing and given (i) by us via email
								(in each case to the address that you provide), or (ii) by User
